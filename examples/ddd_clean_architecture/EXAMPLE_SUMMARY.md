# Summary: Domain-Driven Design with Clean Architecture Example

## ✅ **Successfully Created Custom DDD Architecture Pattern**

This example demonstrates how to implement and test Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with Clean Architecture using GoArchTest, based on your specific project structure.

## 🏗️ **Architecture Structure Implemented**

```
internal/
├── user/                    # User bounded context
│   ├── domain/             # User entities, value objects, interfaces
│   ├── application/        # User use cases, application services  
│   └── infrastructure/     # User repositories, external services
├── products/               # Products bounded context
│   ├── domain/             # Product entities, value objects, interfaces
│   ├── application/        # Product use cases, application services
│   └── infrastructure/     # Product repositories, external services
└── shared/                 # Shared kernel (common domain concepts)

pkg/                        # Reusable utilities and libraries
├── logger/                 # Logging utilities
└── config/                 # Configuration utilities
```

## 🔧 **Custom Architecture Pattern Created**

### **DDDWithCleanArchitecture Pattern**
Added to `architecture_patterns.go`:

```go
dddPattern := goarchtest.DDDWithCleanArchitecture(
    []string{"user", "products"},  // Bounded contexts
    "internal/shared",             // Shared kernel
    "pkg",                        // Utility packages
)
```

### **Rules Enforced**

1. **✅ Clean Architecture within each domain:**
   - Domain layer has no dependencies on application or infrastructure
   - Application layer only depends on domain
   - Infrastructure layer depends on domain (implements interfaces)

2. **✅ Bounded Context Isolation:**
   - User domain cannot import from products domain
   - Products domain cannot import from user domain
   - Each domain is completely independent

3. **✅ Shared Kernel Usage:**
   - Only domain layers can use the shared kernel
   - Application and infrastructure cannot directly use shared

4. **✅ Utility Layer (pkg/) Independence:**
   - Any layer can use pkg/ utilities
   - pkg/ should not depend on internal/ code

## 📝 **Example Files Created**

### **Correct Architecture Examples:**
- `internal/user/domain/user.go` - Domain entities with shared kernel usage
- `internal/user/application/user_service.go` - Application services using domain + pkg
- `internal/user/infrastructure/user_repository.go` - Infrastructure implementing domain interfaces
- `internal/products/domain/product.go` - Independent product domain
- `internal/shared/shared.go` - Shared kernel with common concepts
- `pkg/logger/logger.go` - Reusable logging utilities

### **Intentional Violations for Testing:**
- `internal/user/domain/user_violation.go` - Domain depending on application ❌
- `internal/user/application/user_service_violation.go` - Cross-domain dependency ❌
- `internal/products/application/product_service_violation.go` - Application using shared directly ❌

## 🧪 **Comprehensive Test Suite**

### **Tests Included:**
1. **Predefined DDD Pattern Validation** - Uses the custom pattern
2. **Individual Rule Testing** - Tests each rule separately
3. **Custom Domain Rules** - Domain-specific validation
4. **Repository Pattern Validation** - Ensures proper repository placement

### **Test Output Example:**
```
❌ Bounded context violation detected:
❌ Clean Architecture violation in user domain:
❌ Shared kernel violation in products domain:
```

## 🎯 **Real-World Benefits**

### **For Your Team:**
- **Team Independence**: Teams can work on different domains without conflicts
- **Scalability**: Easy to split domains into microservices later  
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries prevent architectural erosion
- **Onboarding**: New developers understand the architecture through tests

### **For CI/CD:**
- **Automated Validation**: Architecture tests run on every commit
- **Early Detection**: Violations caught before code review
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as living architectural documentation
- **Consistency**: All teams follow the same architectural principles

## 🚀 **Usage in Your Project**

```go
func TestYourDDDArchitecture(t *testing.T) {
    domains := []string{"user", "products", "orders", "billing"}
    pattern := goarchtest.DDDWithCleanArchitecture(
        domains,
        "internal/shared", 
        "pkg",
    )
    
    results := pattern.Validate(goarchtest.InPath("./"))
    
    // Validate results...
}
```

This example provides a complete foundation for implementing and testing DDD with Clean Architecture in Go projects, ensuring your architectural boundaries remain intact as your codebase grows!
